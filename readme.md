it sometimes feels cool to be the guy who's never taken a real programming class who gets by in Python without ever having learned `enumerate` or whatever, but I'm spending enough time on these projects that there's no excuse for being so mediocre. I'm reviewing all the basics I should have learned with the goal of becoming a genuinely excellent programmer, not just pretty good for being self-taught.
